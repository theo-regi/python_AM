Hello,

THE APP REQUIRES ANACONDA INSTALLED.

The AM App is an app that regroups quite simplistic functionnalities usefull to Asset Management.
We regrouped everything in various scipts that calculates performances, volatility and risk metrics (VAR/MDD and so on).
Then, launched some portfolio weights simulations to generate random porfolio to pick an "efficient fronties" (CAPM model).
Find max sharp portfolio or a porfolio based on volatility input.

Then, we continue with other AM examples.

Everything is regrouped under an Streamlit App, that provides an user friendly output.
To use the app, just download the project, put in a directory and launch the launcher.bat.

You might get some security troubles (based on anaconda manipulations and virtual environnements creations/set-up).
Feel free to reach me out in case of troubles.
